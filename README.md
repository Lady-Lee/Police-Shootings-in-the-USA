The recent surge of police killings in the United States has reignited discussions around racism and systemic injustice. This project aims to analyse a dataset of police killings to explore patterns that may reveal racial disparities, particularly in terms of the victims' race, mental health status, and gender. Using Power BI, various data visualizations were created to uncover insights that can guide discussions on this critical issue.

Problem Statements/Questions
1.	Are certain racial groups disproportionately represented in police killings?
What is the racial breakdown of victims in police killings?
2.	Do mental health issues play a significant role in these incidents?
How many of the victims were reported to have shown signs of mental illness during the event?
3.	What are the trends over time in police killings by race?
Are certain years or periods marked by more killings of individuals from specific racial backgrounds?
4.	Does the presence of a weapon influence the likelihood of being shot by the police?
How many victims were unarmed, and what types of weapons were held by those who were armed?
5.	Where are police shootings most concentrated in the United States?
 This identifies the states that are geographic hotspots of police violence and allows for a regional analysis.
6.	What role does body camera usage play in these incidents?
Are they fewer killings when body cameras are worn during present?

Insights and Analysis
1.	Racial Disparities in Police Killings
Contrary to common perceptions, the bar chart reveals that the majority of individuals killed in police shootings are white. While racial minorities are still overrepresented relative to their population sizes, white individuals constitute the largest group of victims in absolute terms. This finding highlights that police violence affects people of all races, though the disproportionate impact on minority communities remains a concern. While white individuals are the largest group in absolute numbers, itâ€™s crucial to contextualize this with their overall population size compared to other racial groups.

2.	Mental Illness and Police Killings
A pie chart analysis of mental illness in the victims shows that a significant portion of those killed had documented mental health issues. This suggests that law enforcement agencies may not be equipped to handle individuals in mental health crises, possibly leading to unnecessary escalations of violence.
3.	Trends Over Time
A line chart of police killings over time, categorized by race, shows periods where spikes in killings occurred for certain racial groups. For instance, there is a noticeable increase in African American deaths during certain years, which may correlate with broader social and political events, such as heightened protests against police violence.
4.	Weapon Use by Victims
A column chart comparing weapon usage among victims reveals that a significant number of those killed were unarmed, or only held non-lethal items. This points to excessive use of force in situations where lethal threats were not present, further fuelling arguments about police overreach in minority communities.
5.	Geographical Distribution of Shootings
A map shows the concentration of shootings across different states. States like California, Texas, and Florida have significantly higher rates of shootings than others.
The high concentration in specific states may be due to population size, policing practices, or social conditions in those regions, warranting localized investigations.
6.	Impact of Body Cameras
The data reveals that in a large number of cases, body cameras were either not worn or not activated. The lack of video evidence can impede investigations and accountability, making it difficult to assess whether police actions were justified in the absence of clear documentation.

Conclusion/Recommendation
This analysis of US police killings reveals several important insights. White individuals form the majority of victims in absolute numbers, but racial minorities, especially Black and Hispanic individuals, are disproportionately affected relative to their population sizes. The data also highlights that a significant portion of those killed were unarmed or posed no immediate threat, raising concerns about police use of force. Over time, police shootings have steadily increased, with certain states showing higher concentrations of incidents.
The findings underscore the urgent need for comprehensive police reform, focusing on enhanced police training, policy reforms, and increased accountability. By addressing these systemic issues, the goal is to reduce unnecessary violence and restore trust between law enforcement and communities across the United States.
This project demonstrates the power of data analytics in uncovering patterns of injustice and can serve as a foundation for further research and policy recommendations aimed at reducing police violence and promoting racial equity in law enforcement.
